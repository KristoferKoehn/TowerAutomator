Accomplishments:
-made debug log manager
-cleaned up main/ moved all upgrade search stuff to upgrade_searcher.py
-got things to run. leveraged near 100% of old code, just rearranged into better architecture
-made upgrade detection *waaay* faster
-pulled all ocr out of functions, now have ocr pool to request.
    -upgrade OCRs on slices which are OCR'd in parallel all at once, real fast.

TODOS:
    -get menu shmovement working
        -gather stage (just scroll down, flick up, then next menu) to get all the costs
        -hunt stage (go to menu of target upgrade, scroll down incrementally until found, hammer click)
    -hook up the rest of debuglogging in upgrade_searcher.
        -hook up current state in debuglogging as well. gotta get that sick shit going
            -ascii animations?? hell yeah.
    
    -start thinking about other states. card modify? claim missions/events? probably. I want this shit to be like 10 
minutes a day tops. hammer through card packs, upgrades, then go about my day. I want to wake up at wave 4500+

    -need to capture wave number for "max wave reached" statistic.
    -think about "starting gem/coin count" implementation for "x gems, y coins farmed" stats
    
    -there's a somewhat infrequent disconnect issue. trying wired for better connection?? or at least plugged in/charging
    -sometimes on quit there's a "rate this app" dialogue that will one-shot the automator if I don't catch.

    -implement a better hands-off toggle. gotta press a button or do like an easy software button or something to turn
off having the mouse yanked randomly.

let's see if it survives the night:  
25.69M coins
1307 gems
success : TBD

7/29/2025
TODOS:
get gem collector finished->
    sigil and claim are ready to go. just need to hook up the toggle and delete shit from main and initialize

get upgrade guy going->
    we get a great environment for this now. don't care about maintaining state, we can scout fast, like <45s
    - need to get OCR data cleaning really tight and with fallbacks. don't want to be stuck trying to upgrade 'rorbs'
    upgrade seeking will be awesome.
        -go to menu that has upgrade
        -go down the list until we see it
        -click on it.
        -when leaving, scroll to the top. this might be psycho fast? like quick flick
        

think about debug system. Gem collector needs to say "hey I clicked on something at this time" and debugger needs to say
"it's been 0 seconds since this happened" and count up like it does now.

mouse controller having the physical input lock toggle would be great, maybe switch over to ctrl-hold for now?
